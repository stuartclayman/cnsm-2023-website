      <!--
      <p>The 19th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM) is inviting authors to submit original contributions in network and service management research. CNSM is a selective single-track conference, covering all aspects of the management of networks and services, pervasive systems, enterprises, and cloud computing environments. CNSM 2023 will particularly focus on advancing network and service management in the era of generative AI and digital twins for improved performance, security and dependability.
      </p>


      

      <p>Papers accepted and presented at CNSM 2023 will be published as open access on the conference website and will be submitted to the IFIP Digital Library. Additionally, accepted papers may possibly be published in IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library. Authors of selected papers accepted for publication in the CNSM 2023 proceedings will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers to the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management journal.        
      </p>

      <p>It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2023 edition
of CNSM, the International Conference on Network and Service
Management.  CNSM is the annual Fall event of the network management
community, co-sponsored by its technical committees, namely the IFIP
working group 6.6 on Network and Distributed Systems Management and
the IEEE Communications Society Committee on Network Operations and
        Management.</p>

      <p>This year we are celebrating the 19th edition of this event and its 14th since the merger in 2010 of what used to be a forum of co-located workshops, a.k.a. Management Week, into a highly selective single‐track conference. Niagara Falls was then home to this merger, and back we are 13 years later, steps away from the majestic Horseshoe Falls. </p>

      <p>CNSM 2023 program builds on the timely and overarching topics of AI and digitalization under the theme of network and service management in the Era of Generative AI and Digital Twins. The 3-day main program features a total of 8 plenary technical paper presentation sessions, a line-up of 5 compelling keynotes from academia and industry, a panel discussion among experts in the field, as well as posters and demonstrations. A mini conference and the 3rd International Workshop on Analytics for Service and Application Management precede the main conference program for focused and scoped technical discussions.   </p>

      <p>CNSM 2023 would have not been possible without the tireless efforts of the organizing and technical committees and the contribution of the authors and the reviewers. We are most grateful to them and to our patrons, sponsors and supporters. We hope that you will enjoy CNSM 2023 technical and social programs in Niagara Falls.</p>
