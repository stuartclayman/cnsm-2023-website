<h1>Continuum Internet and 6G</h1>



<p>Workshop on Continuum Internet and 6G (CI-6G 2023)</p>


<h3>Scope</h3>


<p>The Internet is under significant strain due to its hyper-scale, the increasingly demanding services it is called to support, and the increasing number of smart devices and virtual objects that must be interconnected and interworked. Developing efficient and energy-aware smart vehicles, smart mobile devices, smart homes, smart cities, and other critical applications and data services that rely on the interaction of smart devices and virtual objects is essential. As part of the Internet evolution accommodating smart devices, innovations must consider the different types of smart devices [e.g., Smart Sensors, Smart IoT, Smart edge systems, Smart Cloud Nodes, Smart routers deployed across Continuum Edge IoT, Cloud Computing, Networking and 6G – Continuum Internet (CI)], different communication and management protocols, energy consumption and extra security and service requirements. Efficient micro and hyper-scale interconnection and interworking of smart devices are even more challenging. This is because the number of devices is much larger, and the data rates and services are much higher. Here are some of the challenges needed to be overcome for micro and hyper-scale interconnection and interworking of smart devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Efficient Architectures and frameworks for the Continuum Internet, including Industrial Edge IoT-to-Cloud-to Network Continuum.</li>
  <li>Heterogeneity of Devices: Smart devices come in various shapes, sizes, and capabilities. They may use different communication protocols and have additional security requirements.</li>
  <li>Micro & Hyper Scalability: The number of smart devices is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. This will put a strain on existing interconnection and interworking solutions. It will be necessary to develop new solutions that can scale down/up to support efficiently low/large numbers of devices.</li>
  <li>Security: Smart devices are often connected to the internet, which makes them vulnerable to attacks. It is essential to design interconnection and interworking solutions that take security into account.</li>
  <li>Sustainability: The technical solutions will be integrated into the end-to-end sustainable platforms to support all applications and services to be inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.</li>
  <li>Elastic management: The administration of networks and services with direct support for all their operations. It aims to leverage self-management, automation and autonomic capabilities enabling unprecedented abstraction, disaggregation, operation, integration, and programmability in infrastructures and services. It creates a level of decoupling between the infrastructure delivering the service and the service elements.</li>
  <li>Programmable techniques for remote self-operations and control: techniques for dynamic injection of code for realising application-specific service logic or performing dynamic service provision on demand.</li>
  <li>Integrated data spaces: Edge-to-Cloud-to-Network based Data Spaces for large-scale data operations & relevant capabilities, encompassing the mechanisms for enhanced interoperable data services and data processing across numerous ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Energy consumption: Many smart devices are powered by batteries. Interconnection and internetworking occupied a large part of the power consumption. The design of the protocols and algorithms should consider energy consumption to reduce the overall carbon footprint. </li>
  <li>Mobility: Smart devices may occasionally move, leading to the network topology change. The design of the interconnection and internetworking should cover the mobility aspects. </li>
  <li>New solutions for inter-computing management systems beyond the Internet's inter-networking capabilities would make seamless services execution across multiple inter-working domains possible, each applying different policies and mechanisms for routing, security, access to resources and application services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the Continuum Internet workshop is to highlight recent research related to (i) architectures and frameworks for Continuum Internet, (ii) effective Management and Operations for Continuum Internet, (iii) enhanced Communication, Computing and Network Integrated Technologies and 6G for Interconnected and Interworking of Smart Devices across Continuum Internet and (iv) novel use-cases and testbeds relevant to Continuum Internet and 6G. This WS aims to complement the topics of the CNSM 2023 with a focus on Continuum Internet realisation as part of 6G.</p>
