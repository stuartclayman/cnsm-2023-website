<h1>Block 6G</h1>



<p>1st Workshop on Blockchain-enabled Network Management and Orchestration in 6G Era (BLOCK-6G)</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>


<p>The advent of the 6G era brings forth unprecedented challenges and opportunities in network management and orchestration. As networks become more complex and diverse, there is a growing need for efficient resource allocation, security, trust, and service delivery.  In the 6G era, blockchain technology can play a significant role in enhancing network management and orchestration. Blockchain can provide a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for managing network resources and orchestration. It enables multiple stakeholders, including network operators, service providers, and end-users, to collaborate and trust the system without relying on a central authority.  With blockchain, network resources can be efficiently allocated and shared among multiple entities. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, can automate resource allocation based on predefined rules and current network conditions, enabling dynamic and on-demand resource provisioning.  Blockchain's immutability and cryptographic mechanisms enhance security and business confidentiality in network management and orchestration. It helps prevent unauthorized access, tampering, and fraud, ensuring the integrity of network operations and sensitive data.  Additionally, blockchain-based smart contracts can facilitate the enforcement of SLAs between different entities involved in network management and orchestration. The automated execution and transparency of smart contracts help in monitoring and enforcing SLA compliance, leading to improved service quality and accountability. Blockchain can also enable micropayments, real-time billing, and settlement in network management and orchestration. It allows for transparent and tamper-proof recording of transactions, facilitating automated and secure billing processes among multiple entities involved in network operations. </p>

<p>In this regard, blockchain technology holds many potential applications and benefits for network management and orchestration in the 6G era, unlocking business and operational value to support common tasks such as data processing, networking, and information storage. BLOCK-6G workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers, industry professionals, and academics to explore the intersection of network management, orchestration, and blockchain technology in the 6G era. </p>

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<strong>Workshop paper submission</strong>: 22 August 2023<br/>
<strong>Acceptance Notification</strong>: 2 September 2022<br/>
<strong>Camera Ready</strong>: 8 September 2022<br/>


<h3>Paper Submission Guideline</h3>

<p>Authors are invited to submit original contributions that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers should be prepared using the IEEE 2-column conference style and are limited to 7 pages including references. </p>

<p>Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format through EDAS using <a href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=31285&track=119431">this link</a>. </p>


<h3>Proceedings</h3>

<p>Papers accepted and presented at BLOCK-6G will be submitted for possible inclusion in IEEE Xplore and IFIP Digital Libraries. To be published in the Workshop Proceedings and to be eligible for publication, at least one author of an accepted paper is required to register and present the paper at the workshop. The organizer reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference. Depending on the participation and interest of the participating authors,  extended version of contents of the workshop will be published as a book chapter in this series [1]. </p>
