<h3>Types of Demos</h3>


<p>The expected types of contributions include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demos from authors about the concepts presented in their paper(s)</li>
  <li>Demos from faculty and academic research groups related to CNSM areas</li>
  <li>Demos from industrial researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>A demo will consist of a poster, a live demo, and some slides and videos according to your planned presentation.</p>

<p>A best demo award will be presented at the CNSM 2023 closing ceremony.</p>


 
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

<p>Prospective authors are invited to submit demo proposals, preferably incorporating a demo system architecture illustration, using the IEEE 2-column conference format, and are limited to 3 pages including references. Besides the technical approach and methodology, the proposal should describe what the CNSM audience will experience during the demonstration. The proposal should provide the demo background and further focus on the demo settings and the application, possibly with visual outcomes to illustrate the scope of the demo.</p>

<p>Demo papers must be submitted electronically <a target="_edas" href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=30975&track=118911">through EDAS</a> in PDF format only.</p>

<p>Demo papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted demo papers will be included in the digital conference proceedings provided to CNSM attendees. Papers accepted and presented at CNSM 2023 will be published as open access on the conference website and will be submitted for possible publication in IEEE Xplore.</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted demo paper proposal is required to register to CNSM conference and present the demo at the scheduled demo session.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact the Demo Co-Chairs should you have any questions regarding the demo content or setup.</p>
