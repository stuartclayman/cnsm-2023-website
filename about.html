                <p>The Niagara Falls are voluminous waterfalls on the Niagara River, straddling the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York. The falls are 17 miles (27 km) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York and 75 miles (120 km) south-southeast of Toronto, Ontario, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Niagara Falls is composed of two major sections separated by Goat Island: Horseshoe Falls, the majority of which lies on the Canadian side of the border, and American Falls on the American side. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated from the main falls by Luna Island.x

                <h3>Tips for air travellers</h3>
                <p>
                  The information below is intended to help you make the most convenient travel arrangements, depending on where you are arriving from. The main airports are in Toronto (Canada), Buffalo (U.S.A.) and Hamilton (Canada).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Airport web sites have terminal maps, ground transportation information, as well as airline flight schedule, arrival and departure information, etc.</p>

                <h3 class="cn-no-top-margin">Arriving by air from Canada and anywhere except U.S.A.</h3>
                
                <p>Toronto airport is likely preferable to Buffalo airport as your best arrival point, as you will avoid the extra formalities, documentation, and restrictions that may be incurred passing through the United States. Travel time from Toronto airport to the conference hotel is about 1 1/2 hours. Hamilton Airport is another choice. It is a much smaller airport with limited airlines and routes, but is only about 3/4 of an hour from the conference hotel and in/out times are much shorter.</p>
                
                <h3 >Arriving by air from U.S.A.</h3>
                
                <p>Buffalo airport is likely your best arrival point, as it is the closest airport to Niagara Falls, Canada. Travel time from the airport to the conference hotel is about 1/2 hour, not including delays at the U.S.A./Canada border crossing. Normally, a valid passport (that permits entry into Canada and return to the United States) is required.</p>

                <p>While there are many limousine, taxi, and bus services available at Toronto, Buffalo and Hamilton airports, a commonly used service is Niagara Air Bus (http://www.niagaraairbus.com/) which specializes in service between Niagara Falls and all three airports. You can book on-line through their web site.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that there are two different cities called Niagara Falls, one on the Canadian side of the Niagara River (in the province of Ontario), the other on the American side (in the state of New York).</p>
