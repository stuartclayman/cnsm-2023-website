<h3 class="cnsm-header">Baochun Li, University of Toronto, Canada</h3>

<p>The unprecedented surge in the scale of network topologies and traffic has fueled a pressing demand for rapid simulation of new network designs, prior to both emulation and real-world deployment. However, conventional network simulation techniques do not scale well, due to their high computational costs and low degrees of parallelism. In response, network performance estimators have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging parallel inference of deep neural networks for acceleration. However, these estimators still face challenges in achieving satisfactory scalability and generality.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce some of our recent work on improving the performance, scalability and generality of network performance estimation. I will first introduce DeepQueueNet, our work on using deep neural network models to emulate the behaviour of network devices, supporting arbitrary network topologies and device traffic management mechanisms. For generating training data samples, the design and implementation of DeepQueueNet depended upon our recent work on a new Python-based discrete event simulator, which I developed from scratch. Our extensive experiments showed that DeepQueueNet achieved near-linear speedup in the number of GPUs, and its estimation accuracy for average and 99th percentile round-trip time outperforms existing end-to-end DNN-based performance estimators. I will conclude the talk with key insights in our ongoing work to improve DeepQueueNet.</p>
