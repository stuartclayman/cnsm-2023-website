<h2>Keynote Session 1</h2>

<h2 id="key1" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">Towards Fast, Scalable and Generalized Network Performance Estimation</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Baochun Li, University of Toronto, Canada</h3>

<p>The unprecedented surge in the scale of network topologies and traffic has fueled a pressing demand for rapid simulation of new network designs, prior to both emulation and real-world deployment. However, conventional network simulation techniques do not scale well, due to their high computational costs and low degrees of parallelism. In response, network performance estimators have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging parallel inference of deep neural networks for acceleration. However, these estimators still face challenges in achieving satisfactory scalability and generality.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce some of our recent work on improving the performance, scalability and generality of network performance estimation. I will first introduce DeepQueueNet, our work on using deep neural network models to emulate the behaviour of network devices, supporting arbitrary network topologies and device traffic management mechanisms. For generating training data samples, the design and implementation of DeepQueueNet depended upon our recent work on a new Python-based discrete event simulator, which I developed from scratch. Our extensive experiments showed that DeepQueueNet achieved near-linear speedup in the number of GPUs, and its estimation accuracy for average and 99th percentile round-trip time outperforms existing end-to-end DNN-based performance estimators. I will conclude the talk with key insights in our ongoing work to improve DeepQueueNet.</p>

<h2 id="key2" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">Collaborative Research and Development in 5G Technology: Insights from Rogers Communications' Partnership with Academia</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Wilson Tam, Director 5G Innovation at Rogers, Canada</h3>

<p>Since 2019, Rogers Communications has engaged in a strategic collaboration with two prominent Canadian institutions: the University of Waterloo in Ontario and the University of British Columbia (UBC) in BC. This collaboration has been dedicated to advancing research and development endeavors, with a primary focus on the dynamic realm of 5G technology and its multifaceted use cases. Rogers has demonstrated its substantial commitment by investing millions of dollars in the establishment of 5G smart campuses at both universities, providing services across the low-band, mid-band, and mmWave band spectrums, both indoors and outdoors. Furthermore, Rogers has fostered partnerships for over 20 funded research and development projects, all aimed at exploring ground breaking 5G technologies and their potential use cases</p>

<p>A standout partnership with the University of Waterloo has centered around pioneering work in network slicing, Open Radio Access Network (ORAN), and smart operation & planning of 5G networks.</p>

<p>Additionally, several pivotal projects conducted in collaboration with Waterloo have spanned areas such as asset tracking, teleoperation using robots, edge computing, remote inspection of structures, and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we will share valuable insights gained from our collaborative journey. Additionally, we will explore the technical knowledge we've developed through our active involvement in transformative projects. This includes insights from deploying 28GHz mmWave small cells as part of the 5G smart campus initiatives at Waterloo and UBC.</p>

<h2>Keynote Session 2</h2>

<h2 id="key3" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">Network Management in the Machine Learning Era</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Minlan Yu, Harvard University, USA</h3>

<p>Network management is essential for maintaining high performance, security, and reliability in large scale networks. Network management involves measuring network state, making decisions for various management applications, and enforcing the decisions into individual devices. In lieu of recent progress in machine learning, one natural question is how should we build network management systems to better leverage these emerging techinques.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will discuss three key challenges in building future management systems driven by ML: How to collect a large amount of diverse data to feed into ML systems, how to enable fast and accurate management decisions using ML, and how to enable fast reaction to network events. I'll show a few example systems we built to address these challenges: The first system is DTA, a direct telemetry access framework that aggregates and moves hundreds of millions of reports per second from switches into queryable data structures in collectors’ memory; the second system is Teal, a learning-based algorithm that leverages the parallel processing power of GPUs to accelerate traffic engineering control; finally, I'll discuss our preliminary ideas on enabling fast reactions to network events. </p>

<h2 id="key4" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">From research to product: Lessons from developing a network verification tool</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Ratul Mahajan, University of Washington, USA</h3>

<p>Batfish is a tool to analyze network configurations that is in use at many large enterprises. This talk describes its journey from a research prototype to an industrial-strength product, guided by scalability, fidelity, and usability challenges encountered when analyzing complex, real-world networks. I will share key lessons from this evolution, including how Datalog-based logic programming had significant limitations when generating and analyzing forwarding state and how binary decision diagrams (BDDs) proved highly versatile. I also describe new techniques for addressing real-world challenges, which increase Batfish performance by three orders of magnitude and enable high-fidelity analysis of networks with thousands of nodes within minutes. I end with observations on key blockers (and ongoing work) on broader use of network verification, including the lack of automation inside most networks and lack of feedback on test quality.</p>
